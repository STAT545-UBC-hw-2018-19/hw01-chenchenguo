## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
/* Install the nasaweather package firstly*/
```{r cars}
library(nasaweather)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
/* Information of data set storms of package nasaweather*/
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
str(storms)

head(storms)

ncol(storms)
nrow(storms)

summary(storms)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
/* Calculating the variance with one method and var function  of  pressure which belongs to storm data set*/
```{r}
na_pres<- storms$pressure
length(na_pres)
max(na_pres)
min(na_pres)

ave<- (sum(na_pres)/(length(na_pres)))
diffs<- (na_pres-ave)
variance<- (sum(diffs^2)/(length(na_pres)-1))
variance

var(na_pres)
```
